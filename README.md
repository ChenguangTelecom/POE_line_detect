This is the original implementation of our paper "A novel Pixel Orientation Estimation based line segment detection framework, and its applications to SAR images". The algorithm is proposed to detect line segments from binary edge maps, which can be an excellent alternative for Hough transform to detect line segments from binary edge maps. The proposed method can be combined with any edge detector. Please read 'demo.m' to know how to use it. Before running demo.m, please type 'mex poe_line_detect.c poe.c' to compile the mex files. Please cite our paper if you are using this code.
